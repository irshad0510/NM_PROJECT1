📊 Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning
📝 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for many businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on historical data, uncovering hidden patterns that can help businesses take proactive actions to retain customers.

This model analyzes customer behavior, demographic information, and service usage to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving. By leveraging techniques such as feature engineering, classification algorithms, and performance evaluation metrics, we aim to deliver a robust and interpretable solution.

🔍 Objectives
Identify key factors that influence customer churn.

Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.

Use data visualization to uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior.

Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
